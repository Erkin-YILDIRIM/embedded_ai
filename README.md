# STM32 Embedded AI Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
This project focuses on integrating lightweight AI decision-making algorithms into resource-constrained embedded systems using the STM32 microcontroller platform. The main goal is to implement a simple decision tree algorithm to enable real-time decision-making based on sensor inputs, optimized for limited memory and power usage.

## Goals
- Implement and demonstrate STM32 microcontroller capabilities with ARM Cortex-M architecture.
- Configure and utilize peripherals such as UART and ADC for sensor data acquisition and communication.
- Develop an embedded decision tree algorithm in C tailored for microcontroller constraints.
- Evaluate the system's performance and power consumption on STM32 hardware.
- Maintain clear project documentation and version control through Git and GitHub.
